<h1>This is my top 5 best movies</h1>
<h2> This includes my top pics and the movies that I have enjoyed the most watching on theaters, I have a very diverse taste (no judging)</h2>

<ol> 
    <li><b>Finding Nemo</b></li>
<h5>Finding Nemo was my favourite movie as kid, and the first movie I watch on a movie theater, is ranked as my number one not only because of the nostalgia, but also because finding nemo is an absolute masterpiece.</h5>
    <li><b>Mickey 17</b></li>
    <h5>I watched this one recently, this movie has it all, shows how pure feelings can be and how the diverse are our emotions, it has good comedy pieces as well</h5>
    <li><b>Elemental</b></li>
    <h5>This is another animated master piece, it shows how oposites can be attracted to each other, and that when comes to love the only this that matters is your opion and your partner's, who cares what others think</h5>
    <li><b>Dune 2</b></li>
    <h5>This is by far my favourite sci-fi movie, the action, the soundtrack, the scenery, everything is just perfect. Is so easy to get absorbed by the storyline and a two and half hour movie can feel like a 30 minute episode of a tv show, so entertaining.</h5>
    <li><b>Just Go With It</b></li>
    <h5>This one is the movie I watch whenever I want to laugh, I watched it with my mom the first time, we had such a good time, and I think everytime I rewatch it, it takes back to that first time. You won't stop laughing with this one. </h5>
